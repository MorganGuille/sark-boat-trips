## Welcome to the repository for Sark Boat Trips, a functioning website and booking system developed during the Barcelona Code School Bootcamp.

This project serves as the official website and operational booking engine for a small boat trip business. The primary goal was to create a low-cost, flexible, and robust booking solution that is easy to maintain and scale for a small business.

In the past I had used paid booking systems but they didnt suit my specific needs for my local area and conditions, so I built my own!

### Key Features
- User-Friendly Interface: Clear, intuitive design for browsing available boat trips and information.

- Flexible Booking System: Custom-built to handle various trip types, capacities, and schedules.

- Secure Backend: Utilizes Express.js for routing and MongoDB for flexible data storage.

- Full-Stack JavaScript: Built entirely using JavaScript for both the frontend and backend.

### This is a classic MERN stack implementation, using JavaScript across the board.

## Project Structure
The project is structured to clearly separate concerns:

`client` contains the frontend with seperate `views` `css` and `components` 

`server` contains the backend code seperated into : 

`/models: Contains the Mongoose schemas for MongoDB (availability.js, booking.js, notes.js).`

`/routes: Defines the Express API endpoints.`

`/controllers: contains the logic`
